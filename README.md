# License Plate Recognition Dataset
Dataset offers **62 666** images of vehicles featuring license plates from Italy, making it an excellent resource for tasks involving **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition), **license plate identification**, and **vehicle registration** data extraction. Each image is accompanied by a CSV file that provides the corresponding plate text and country code, ideal for developing and testing text recognition systems.

By leveraging this dataset, developers can enhance optical character recognition (**OCR**) accuracy, improve **identification of stolen vehicles**, and refine parking management solutions. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/italy-license-plate-detection-dataset/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=italy-license-plate-dataset)**

Each image includes precise bounding box coordinates for plate localization and character segmentation, supporting high-accuracy recognition systems in real-world conditions.
